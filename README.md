# hello-world
Getting started from the ground up on animation &amp; game creation.
This repository is temporarily being used as a placeholder for my upcoming project. I want to make my first 2D game!
While I'm going to my best to learn any and all skills necessary for said project, I know it's dangerous to go alone. If you're willing to help me out a bit, the Issue posted on this repository is basically asking what kind of programs I'll need to create and publish this project besides Spriter Pro and Construct 2. Also any tips or tricks for those programs would be much appreciated, though I've run through quite a few tutorials so far.
